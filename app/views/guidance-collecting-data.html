      <p class="govuk-body">
        All evidence base studies require some elements of data and standardised information to be collected. Whilst this will vary from study to study, there are some consistent elements that apply to most elements of a place under study; current population and supply, future supply and future demand, with some analysis required to understand future surplus/deficits.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Similarly we are seeking to collect data consistently, so are requiring core evidence base data to be collected to have:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>consistent format</li>
        <li>consistent metadata: metadata summarises basic information about data, making finding and working with data easier  </li>
        <li>typologies: how different factors can be classified, from types of employment land, sports facilities, utilities assets etc</li>
        <li>associated definitions to explain the typology</li>
        <li>benchmarks, in some instances can be specified: these are not targets but often averages against which local divergences can be explained and used to guide policy.</li>
      </ul>

        Metadata is information about the data that helps others to better understand the data. Metadata you should provide about your open space data:
